## Dataset Details

This dataset consists of 638 images collected by Roboflow from two aquariums in the United States: The Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha (October 16, 2020) and the National Aquarium in Baltimore (November 14, 2020). The images were labeled for object detection by the Roboflow team (with some help from SageMaker Ground Truth). Images and annotations are released under a Creative Commons By-Attribution license. You are free to use them for any purposes personal, commercial, or academic provided you give acknowledgement of their source.

## Class Breakdown

The following classes are labeled: fish, jellyfish, penguins, sharks, puffins, stingrays, and starfish. Most images contain multiple bounding boxes.

## Usage

The dataset is provided in many popular formats for easily training machine learning models. We have [trained a model with CreateML](https://blog.roboflow.com/createml/) (see gif above).

This dataset could be used for coral reef [conservation](https://blog.roboflow.com/how-this-fulbright-scholar-is-using-computer-vision-to/), [environmental health monitoring](https://blog.roboflow.com/using-computer-vision-to-count-fish-populations/), swimmer [safety](https://roboflow.com/industries/safety-and-security), pet analytics, automated feeding, and much more. We're excited to see what you build!

# Overview

![Drone Example](/images/drone-catch.gif =140x250)

This dataset contains 74 images of aerial maritime photographs taken with via a Mavic Air 2 drone and 1,151 bounding boxes, consisting of docks, boats, lifts, jetskis, and cars. This is a multi class problem. This is an aerial object detection dataset. This is a maritime object detection dataset.

The drone was flown at 400 ft. ~~No drones were harmed in the making of this dataset.~~

This dataset was collected and annotated by the Roboflow team, released with MIT license.

# Use Cases

* Identify number of boats on the water over a lake via quadcopter.
* Boat object detection dataset
* Aerial Object Detection proof of concept
* Identify if boat lifts have been taken out via a drone
* Identify cars with a UAV drone
* Find which lakes are inhabited and to which degree.
* Identify if visitors are visiting the lake house via quad copter.
* Proof of concept for UAV imagery project
* Proof of concept for maritime project
* Etc.

This dataset is a great starter dataset for building an aerial object detection model with your drone.
# Getting Started

Fork or download this dataset and follow our [How to train state of the art object detector YOLOv4](https://blog.roboflow.ai/training-yolov4-on-a-custom-dataset/) for more. Stay tuned for particular tutorials on how to teach your UAV drone how to see and comprable airplane imagery and airplane footage. 

# Annotation Guide

See here for [how to use the CVAT annotation tool](https://blog.roboflow.ai/getting-started-with-cvat/) that was used to create this dataset.
